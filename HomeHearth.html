                                    <h3 class="major">HomeHeart: What is there to know?</h3>


									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DemoScene.png" alt="" /></span> HomeHearth is the resoult of the last big game project assignment of the Technical Artist and Game Programming courses called <i>Stora spel</i>, or <i>Big Game</i>. 
                                        The game was developed by a team of ten creators, seven of which are from the Game Programming course and three from the Technical Artist course. 
                                        Some of us had worked together on a smaller game project earlier the same year and as we thought we worked really well together we thought to continue as a team for this project, with an addition of six people of course.
                                        I was elected leader and scrum master by the group and continued to lead our group to an (almost) finished game at the end of the year.
                                        I took the responsibility of creating the buildings, characters, rigs, animation, textures, UI graphics and water method for the game.</p>
										<P></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ByborConsept.png" alt="" /></span> HomeHearth is a tower defense sort of game meaning defenses are built around a base. The base in this case is a tiny little town populated by villages. At night monsters start to crawl out from the shadows (forest around the map) in waves
                                        and start dealing damage to the houses in the town. As the game progresses the waves get harder and harder to deal with and at some waves bosses and different creatures start to appear. If defenses happen to be in the way of the 
                                        houses the monsters prioritize breaking down the defenses first. If a house were to get destroyed the villagers that lived in there 
                                        pop out and start running around like crazy, vulnerable for the monsters to kill. Once all the villagers or players defending the village are killed, the game is over. As it is, the game can not be won, but players can work together to 
                                        survive the most rounds. 
                                        Oh, did I say that the game is multiplayer? It is hosted on a server and up to four players can join a lobby and play together.
                                        Players can upgrade defenses, their own strength, and health. There are also two different classes a player can choose from: Warrior and Mage. </p>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GridMap.png" alt="" /></span>We did not really have an excessive amount of time to throw around concept sketches, but 
											the fun fact is that the game was supposed to take place during summertime. This got changed though because... Well, the season outside started to change and I got fall feelings! The others
											did not mind the change after a small speech from my part at the morning meeting.</p>

									<p>To date, we as a team are planning to redevelop the game in a less obnoxious game engine (one that was created by professionals, like Unreal or Unity) in the future and further develop the game into something that could actually be interesting 
											to more players. As it looks now, the idea has changed a lot and I am excited to see what might come of the new game, may it be far in the future.

									<p> That fun little picture on the right there is only used for A-Star node placement. Each pixel represents one node and one length unit in both Maya and our game engine. The texture is 70 x 70.
                                        The gray means "Spawn node here", The blue is the placement of the houses, the blue is the placement of trees and rocks, the yellow is where the lake is, and the black bridges. 
                                        The different colors are necessary to tell the AI how to act around these areas. For example: things can be shot through the yellow area but not the red. 
										
									
									<h3 class="major">All the stuff</h3>
										<h4>Some of the building components</h4>

										<h4>The characters</h4>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CharacterCollage.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<p>The characters was at first thought to have different skin colors and armor colors, you know, for some variation, but i really did not have time for this in the end. 
													The Mage character was literaly created in a day about a week before deadline. 
													The characters landed at a total of about 8000 triangles each. (Except the monster, he got about 4000)</p>

													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPHit.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPIdle.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPDamage.gif" alt="" /></span></div>	
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPRun.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
														
														
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPMonsterDamage.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPMonsterIdle.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPMonsterHit.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/SPMonsterWalk.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
													
													<p>So, I got some fun weighing errors with the monster animations in these gifs. 
													This is once again me being too lazy to find the correct weighted model to showcase the animation. I will probably update this in the future! 
													The villager do not really have any interesting animations so i did not feel like uplaoding them. They just stand idle and walk sometimes.
													The animations are created using the Human IK rig generated by Maya.</p>

										<h4>The Level</h4>

												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/WireMapSP.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<p> The camera angle on this game is locked and seen through a perspective camera. Most of the grass and flower planes are angled to face the camera as well as the planes on trees.
													The whole level, trees, houses and all came to a total of 67 429 triangles. </p>
												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/S1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/S2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Scene.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<p>- Maya viewport 2.0 render. </p>
												<p> I really liked this pink light as a beginning of the night kind of lighting, but i was voted down by the team and we ended up with a typical dark bluish tint for the light och the night.
													It was debated to use this ligtihing for potential blood moon events though wich i really agreed with, but the blood moon was never added for this project :( . 
													All the textures used range from 128 x 128 to 1024 x 1024. </p>
