                                    <h3 class="major">HomeHeart: What is there to know?</h3>
                                    <p>HomeHearth is the resoult of the last big game project assignment of the Technical Artist and Game Programming courses called <i>Stora spel</i>, or <i>Big Game</i>. 
                                        The game was developed by a team of ten creators, seven of which are from the Game Programming course and three from the Technical Artist course. 
                                        Some of us had worked together on a smaller game project earlier the same year and as we thought we worked really well together we thought to continue as a team for this project, with an addition of six people of course.
                                        I was elected leader and scrum master by the group and continued to lead our group to an (almost) finished game at the end of the year.
                                        I took the responsibility of creating the graphic for the game as my teammates preferred game development through programming, which was nothing but my delight.


                                    <p>HomeHearth is a tower defense sort of game meaning defenses are built around a base. The base in this case is a tiny little town populated by villages. At night monsters start to crawl out from the shadows (forest around the map) in waves
                                        and start dealing damage to the houses in the town. As the game progresses the waves get harder and harder to deal with and at some waves bosses and different creatures start to appear. If defenses happen to be in the way of the 
                                        houses the monsters prioritize breaking down the defenses first. If a house were to get destroyed the villagers that lived in there 
                                        pop out and start running around like crazy, vulnerable for the monsters to kill. Once all the villagers or players defending the village are killed, the game is over. As it is, the game can not be won, but players can work together to 
                                        survive the most rounds. 
                                        Oh, did I say that the game is multiplayer? It is hosted on a server and up to four players can join a lobby and play together.
                                        Players can upgrade defenses, their own strength, and health. There are also two different classes a player can choose from: Warrior and Mage. 

                                    <p>To date, we as a team are planning to redevelop the game in a less obnoxious game engine (one that was created by professionals, like Unreal or Unity) in the future and further develop the game into something that could actually be interesting 
                                        to more players. As it looks now, the idea has changed a lot and I am excited to see what might come of the new game, may it be far in the future.

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ByConceptArtButBig.png" alt="" /></span>This is the only concept art for the level design. We did not really have an excessive amount of time to throw around concept sketches, but 
                                        the fun fact is that the overall feel was supposed to be green and take place during summertime. This got changed though because... Well, the season outside started to change and I got fall feelings! The others
                                        did not mind the change after a small speech from my part at the morning meeting.</p>
										<P></p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Scene.png" alt="" /></span> This is basically the resoult. A quick render in Maya. I did not have the time to create a nice Arnold render for the scene becouse <i> time. </i> 
									please do not mind the black background but it give a good enough idea at least. We did not end up having this nice and cozy pink lithing in the game thought. We found it pretty hard to get a asteticly pleasing light at 
									any time of the day in the game, oh, i probably forgot to menthon that the game have a day and night cykle too.  </p>
